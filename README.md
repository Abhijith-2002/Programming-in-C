## How to Compile & Run

To compile and run any of the programs in this repository, you will need a C compiler, such as **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**, installed on your system.

**General Steps:**

1.  **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to the directory** containing the C file you want to run.
3.  **Compile the file** using the `gcc` command. For example, to compile `prime.c`:
    ```bash
    gcc prime.c -o prime
    ```
    This command compiles `prime.c` and creates an executable file named `prime`.
4.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./prime
    ```
Specific commands for each program are provided below.
